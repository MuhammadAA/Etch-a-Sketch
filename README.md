- Allows users to drag mouse over the grid and change colors to black
- You can choose the color input and select any color you wish, after which the blocks turn into the selected color
- You can choose to change the color of the squares to a random color by clicking on the "Random Color" button
- You can reset the grid to return to its original state by clicking on the "Reset" button
- You can choose the size of the grid by clicking and dragging the range input, you can select any value from 1 to 64 which will determine the size of the grid
  - The number of squares on the grid are the same as the number of the range input multiplied by itself (Ex. Original grid is 16x16 squares in size)
- Changing the size of the grid causes the grid to turn white again
